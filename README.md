Energy Consumption Prediction
Description
This project aims to predict energy consumption based on historical data and relevant features. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project provides accurate forecasts of energy usage, enabling stakeholders to optimize resource allocation and make informed decisions for energy management.

**USAGE**


Preprocess the data:
Clean the dataset.
Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Perform feature engineering.

Train the model:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Choose and train machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, time series analysis).
Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

Evaluate the model:
Assess prediction accuracy using metrics like MAE, RMSE, or R-squared.
Compare performance across different algorithms.
Validate model results on unseen data.

Deployment:
Deploy the trained model for real-time energy consumption prediction.
Continuously monitor and update the model for improved accuracy.
